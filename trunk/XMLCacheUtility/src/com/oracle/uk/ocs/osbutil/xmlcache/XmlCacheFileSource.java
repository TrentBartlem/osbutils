/**
 * File-based implementation of XmlCacheSource
 * 
 * <p>The is a file-based implementation of <code>XmlCacheSource</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This implementation provides a very simple implementation that looks in a
 * base directory for XML files that are named the same as the key. For example
 * if this implementation is asked for the XML keyed-off 'test' then it will
 * look for a file called 'xmlcache/test.xml'.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Any forward slashes in the kay are preserved when calculating the filename
 * therefore sub-directories can be specified with the appropriate key.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Configuration</h2>
 * 
 * <p>The following describes the scoped configuration keys that configure this
 * XML source. These scoped keys are appended to the configuration basekey in
 * order to find the appropriate property in the configuration.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The following example shows an excerpt from a configuration file that
 * specifies an XML source called 'xmlcache' that is an instance of
 * XmlCacheFileSource that reads out the base directory 'xmlcachedir'.</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ...
 * source.xmlcache.class=com.oracle.ukps.osbutil.xmlcache.XmlCacheFileSource
 * source.xmlcache.basedir=xmlcachedir
 * ...
 * </pre>

 *         separate paths. Java will convert these if necessary.</td>
