#summary Provides a bridge from JDK Logging to the WebLogic Server logging

= Introduction =

This sub-project provides a JDK logging handler implementation that delegates to the WebLogic Server logging mechanism. This allows other classes to be written using the JDK logging but later be configured to integrate with the WebLogic Server logs.


* WebLogic 11g (10.3) and greater provide a production standard bridge implementation shipped with the product that should be used in preference to this implementation. See the [http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E14571_01/web.1111/e13739/logging_services.htm WebLogic Server logging documentation] for more information.*
